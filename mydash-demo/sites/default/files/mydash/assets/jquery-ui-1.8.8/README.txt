These files are being used by prod/inc/mydash/mydash.php and
prod/inc/mydash/myfeeds.php.  The release notes for the current
jquery-ui, 1.10, say "Note that most 1.8 APIs which were deprecated in
1.9 were removed in 1.10 and will not exist, regardless of the
$.uiBackCompat flag."  TODO: test these files with the new version.
